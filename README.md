# Hacking the Zooniverse
### [0] Zooniverse at MozFest 2014

We've been developing citizen science websites since 2009 and have grown a community of over one million volunteers. We have projects ranging from astronomy to zoology and the family grows all the time. We are currently working on a new platform, based on our existing infrastructure, that will make creating a Zooniverse-style citizen science project as easy as setting up a blog - or making a simple app.

MozFest is an opportunity for us to connect with the other makers and thinkers in this space and to work on new and interesting ideas together. We have a sprint session  (Saturday, 11-1).
### [1] Some History

#### Short history.

[Galaxy Zoo](http://zoo1.galaxyzoo.org) was created out of genuine need - not for fun, not for outreach - and it has been a game-changer for galaxy morphology. Two other projects that are especially relevant to MozFest (but do check out others on [zooniverse.org](zooniverse.org)) are the [Milky Way Project](http://www.milkywayproject.org) and [Penguin Watch](http://www.penguinwatch.org).

#### Short future.
We're building a system that shows our vision of that for Zooniverse. The code base is called Panoptes. It will enable people to remix and rebuild citizen science projects like the ones we build today, without our input or even much technical know-how.

#### Open Source, Open Data, Open Science.
Open Source is easy (barring documentation, which is hard). Open Data is harder but easy in the short term, and the real challenge is cultural change. Open Science is tricky because of tenure, H-indexes, and academic politics. Citizen scientists don't care about those things though :)

#### Today...
...is about hacking some new ideas and evolving some existing ones. We have some strands we want to work within this morning: research, communication and education. We have ideas of hacks that can be done in those strands but do t feel limited to those.

These projects don't end at 1pm. We want to stay in touch with the things that come out of today and try to support them.

### [2] Split Into Groups

There are three strands. Pick one and start talking. We're allowing 15 mins for brainstorming and then we want people to pitch something to the room and work on that until they feel it's run it's course. That might be in 10 minutes or when you're cut off at the end of this sprint. 

Let's try and make something. We have a community of 1.2M people that we'd love to share these things with, once they're up and running.

#### Creating online tools for researchers

We have open data sets, but how to allow researchers to get what they need, and trust data? This is Milkman but let's create a more generic tool for exploring huge, annotated datasets with statistical power built in and even ML where possible.

#### Creating data visualisations for science communication.
Here are some visualisations using Hubble and Montage on galaxies; and then using D3 on Galaxy Zoo results. The different is data and interactivity. Is there a 'grand visualisation' that can help us to convey data(bases) without losing the scientific rigour? We've never done something like this for MWP.

#### Using online citizen science for informal education.

This is ZooTeach and the Navigator, but let's turn that model on its head imagine a distributed classroom, where citizen science holds them together and they learn as they work on tasks.

#### Something completely new.

Maybe you have an idea for a hack? Come find us.

### [3] How Does This End? What's the point?

Each project should aim to conclude with the following at least:

1. A 2-minute summary - with drawings if you like :)
2. A point of contact, with an email address
3. A GitHub repo with a description of the project, maybe the summary from Step (?), and code if there is any 

Let's not walk away and never talk again - let's leave ready to make these ideas happen if we want!
